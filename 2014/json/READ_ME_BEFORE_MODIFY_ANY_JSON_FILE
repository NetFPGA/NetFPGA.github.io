- to change the SYSTEMS page: modify the /json/systems.json file. 

- to change the EVENTS page: modify the /json/events.json file.

- to change the NEWS page: modify the /json/news.json file.

JSON ADVISES:

- you can write HTML text but only to the fields that have been specified to use HTML text

- the text of each field has to be in one line! otherwise the code will break

- DO NOT USE "" inside the field. JSON uses "" to define its object, so DO USE '' ONLY!
	eg if you want to add a url link inside HTML text, you need to write it like this:
		<a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/NetFPGA/netfpga/wiki/Guide'>The Guide</a>

- MUST compile your code here: http://jsonlint.com/ before you push it live - it will help you recognize syntax errors

- be carefull with commas (,) , all kind of brackets (), [], {}, quotes "", ''  and HTML tags

- see how the rest of each file is formed and copy the same format if you want to add new content
