Anybody can get an [evaluation license](http://www.xilinx.com/ipcenter/ipevaluation/10ge_mac_evaluation.htm) for free which allows the end-user to simulate the system, however bitstream generation is limited. For a full hardware license, academic end-users can request a donation through the Xilinx University Program. Other end-users have to purchase a "SignOnce" license. Evaluation license or the full license can get obtained through the links on the [10G MAC](http://www.xilinx.com/products/ipcenter/DO-DI-10GEMAC.htm) page.
