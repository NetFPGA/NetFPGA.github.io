## Contributing projects and modules ##
<br />
We encourage you to contribute as a Developer to the NetFPGA Community. Contributed projects can consist of hardware (Verilog gateware, behavioral code, and/or structural code), software (drivers, scripts, and/or GUIs), or a combination of both. Projects use the results of hardware tests to define and verify their functionality.
