<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>An open platform called the <a href="{% link index.html %}">NetFPGA</a> has been developed at Stanford University. The NetFPGA platform enables researchers and instructors to build high-speed, hardware-accelerated networking systems. The platform can be used in the classroom to teach students how to build Ethernet switches and Internet Prototcol (IP) routers using hardware rather than software. The platform can be used by researchers to prototype advanced services for next-generation networks.</p>
<p>By using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), the NetFPGA enables new types of packet routing circuits to be implemented and detailed measurements of network traffic to be obtained. During the tutorial, we will use the NetFPGA to determine the amount of memory needed to buffer TCP/IP data streaming through the Gigabit/second router. Hardware circuits within the NetFPGA will be implemented to measure and plot the occupancy of buffers. Circuits will be downloaded into reconfigurable hardware and tested with live, streaming Internet video traffic.</p>
<p>This full-day hands-on tutorial will be held in a classroom or laboratory equipped with ten PCs with NetFPGA hardware on Sunday, March 21, 2010.</p>

<br>
<br>

<h3>Background</h3>

<br>

<p>Attendees will utilize a Linux-based PC equipped with NetFPGA hardware. A basic understanding of Ethernet switching and network routing is expected. Past experience with Verilog is useful but not required. This full-day tutorial extends the material presented at previous NetFPGA Turorials from 2007-2009 (FPL 2009, SIGCOMM 2008, Hot Interconnects 2007, SIGMETRICS 2007). Information about previous events as well as a description of the NetFPGA Platform are available on-line from the <a href="{% link index.html %}">NetFPGA</a> homepage.</p>
