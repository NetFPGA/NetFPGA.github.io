    <p>NetFPGA Plus provides a platform for rapid prototying of networking projects. It provides a combination of open-source code, community, and contributions over a number of the Xilinx <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo.html" tabindex="0">Alveo</a> FPGA cards. To make users' development experience quick and easy, PLUS offers the NetFPGA reference projecs, test/measurement environment, and expereince using different Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA. The NetFPGA project makes extensive use of the Vivado development environment and draws features from the <a href="https://github.com/Xilinx/open-nic-shell" tabindex="0"><i>OpenNic Shell</i></a>, including PCIe-DMA interfaces and the CMAC/100GbE physical Ethernet interfaces.</p>
    <p>Current targets (as at May 2021) are the Alveo U200, Alveo U250, Alveo U280 and the older Xilinx VCU1525 Acceleration Development Kit. Common features of these target boards is the use of the UltraScale+ FPGA along with dual 100GbE ports, x16 gen3 PCIe HBA (host bus adapter) interface. Communitty ports to new targets are also keenly encouraged</p>
    <p>NetFPGA Plus can be used as a smart NIC (network interface card), layer2 switch, IP router, test/measurement environment, firewall, network functions prototyping environment, and more. A number of reference projects are included as standard</p>
