<h1>Why NetFPGA</h1>

<p>The NetFPGA enables researchers and students to build working prototypes of high-speed, hardware-accelerated networking systems. The NetFPGA has been used in the classroom to teach students how to build Ethernet switches and Internet Protocol (IP) routers that use hardware rather than software to forward packets. The NetFPGA hardware can be used by researchers to prototype new types of clean-slate services for next-generation networks. The NetFPGA supports multiple usage models each allowing a user to build a hardware-accelerate router with as little or as much customization as they desire.</p>
