# NetFPGA in the classroom #

* [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/) 
   * [CS344 Build an Internet Router](http://yuba.stanford.edu/cs344/) 
     * Students work in teams of two to build an operational Internet router. The forwarding path is implemented in hardware and a routing algorithm and control interface are implemented in software.
   * [EE109 Digital Design Lab](http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee109/) 
     * Students produce a video conferencing system. NetFPGA is used to implement a learning Ethernet switch as part of this system.
* [Rice University](http://www.rice.edu/)
  * [COMP529: Network Systems Architecture](http://comp519.cs.rice.edu/index.php/Network_Systems_Architecture)
* [Cambridge University Computer Laboratory](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) 
  * [P33: Build an Internet Router](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/current/P33/) 
    * Based on SU/CS344: Students work in teams of two to build an operational Internet router. The forwarding path is implemented in hardware and a routing algorithm and control interface are implemented in software.
