Any registration without a valid Github account will be ignored automatically without further notice due to the limitation of Google Forms.

After we've added your GitHub username to the access list you will receive email from the Beta list server telling you to get started at [NetFPGA 10G Getting Started](https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/Getting-Started-Guide)
