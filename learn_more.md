The NetFPGA is an open source hardware and software platform designed for research and teaching.  Currently there are two platforms: NetFPGA-1G (1G) and the NetFPGA-10G (10G).  These platforms allow researchers, and students to build prototypes of high-speed, hardware-accelerated networking systems.  As of 2011 the NetFPGA platforms have been used in over [66 academic papers](publications.html). Both platforms are open-source and the hardware is made available at low cost through donations of gifts and silicon chips by [sponsors](sponsors.html) of the NetFPGA project.

The [NetFPGA 1G platform](1G_specs.html) is a PCI card that contains a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro 50 FPGA, 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports, Static RAM (SRAM), Double-Date Rate (DDR2) Dynamic RAM (DRAM). 

* [The Guide](https://github.com/NetFPGA/netfpga/wiki/Guide) provides details about using NetFPGA 1G.
* [The Developer's Guide](https://github.com/NetFPGA/netfpga/wiki/DevelopersGuide) provides details about creating projects with the NetFPGA 1G.
* [NetFPGA 1G license](1G_license.html)

The [NetFPGA 10G platform](10G_specs.html) is a PCI-e card that contains a Xilinx Virtex 5 FPGA, 4 SFP+ interfaces, supports both 1G and 10G modes, QDRII SRAM, RLDRAM.

[Tutorials](events.html) have been held [worldwide](events_map.html) to teach new users with hands-on experience using the NetFPGA. There are now over 150 [groups around the globe](deployment_map.html) that use the NetFPGA.
