<h1>About NetFPGA</h1>
<p>The NetFPGA is an open source hardware and software platform designed for research and teaching. Currently there are three supported platforms: NetFPGA-SUME, NetFPGA-1G-CML and the NetFPGA-10G and one deprecated platform: NetFPGA-1G. These platforms allow researchers, and students to build prototypes of high-speed, hardware-accelerated networking systems. As of 2014 the NetFPGA platforms have been used in over <a href="{% link Publications.html %}">226 academic papers.</a> Both platforms are open-source and the hardware is made available at low cost through donations of gifts and silicon chips by sponsors of the NetFPGA project.</p>
<p><a href="{% link events.html %}">Tutorials</a> have been held <a href="{% link events-map.html %}">worldwide</a> to teach new users with hands-on experience using the NetFPGA. There are now over <a href="{% link deployment-map.html %}">150 groups around the globe</a> that use the NetFPGA.</p>
