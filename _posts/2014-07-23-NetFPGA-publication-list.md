Dear NetFPGA community members,

We are currently updating the contents of NetFPGA's publication list, which can be seen through the following link [https://netfpga.org/publications.html]({% link Publications.html%})

Please contact me directly in case you have any publications involving the NetFPGA platform that are not mentioned in the list. This way we provide the most relevant project developments to the community.

Thanks,

Gianni Antichi <br> <a href="mailto:gianni.antichi@cl.cam.ac.uk">gianni.antichi@cl.cam.ac.uk</a>
