Greetings Everyone,

We are pleased to announce the release of OSNT-SUME (available via [www.osnt.org](https://osnt.org)).

The initial OSNT-SUME project is a port of the NetFPGA-10G based OSNTsystem. We are currently planning a native implementation of OSNT-SUME thatwill be able to exploit all the SUME platform capabilities.

The OSNT-SUME repository follows the same criteria as the NetFPGA-SUME repository registration: [http://netfpga.org/SUME-reg-form.html](/SUME-reg-form.html)

Users that have access to the NetFPGA-SUME repo will have also the access to OSNT-SUME.

We invite everyone from the community to audit (and improve) our implementation as well as adapt it to their needs

NetFPGA developers are encouraged to use/contribute to OSNT-SUME repository:
