Greetings NetFPGA Community,

We are pleased to announce the release of OSNT ([www.osnt.org](http://osnt.org/)).

The Open Source Network Tester (OSNT) based on the NetFPGA-10G platform, is a the world's first open-source hardware traffic generator and capture system.

OSNT repository follows the same criteria as the NetFPGA-10G repository.

Users that have access to the NetFPGA-10G repo will also have access to OSNT.

We invite everyone from the community to audit (and improve) our implementation as well as adapt it to their needs.

More information can be found at [https://github.com/NetFPGA/OSNT-Public](https://github.com/NetFPGA/OSNT-Public) NetFPGA developers are encouraged to use/contribute to OSNT repository.
