We are pleased to announce an upcoming NetFPGA tutorial in Lexington, KY on March 21, 2010.

During the tutorial, we will use the NetFPGA to determine the amount of memory needed to buffer TCP/IP streaming through the Gigabit/second router. Hardware circuits within the NetFPGA will be implemented to measure and plot the occupancy of buffers. Circuits will be downloaded into reconfigurable hardware and tested with live, streaming Internet video traffic.

Attendees will utilize a Linux-based PC equipped with NetFPGA hardware. A basic understanding of Ethernet switching and network routing is expected. Past experience with Verilog is useful but not required.

Details about this event and registration information are posted on-line.
