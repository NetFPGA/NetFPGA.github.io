Greetings everyone,

We are happy to announce the next NetFPGA-1G-CML release (5.0.5).

Below you can find the release notes for 5.0.5:

1. projects/reference_nic_nf1_cml: <br> The project was modified to support out-of-the-box configuration when it is installed in the on-board BPI during manufacturing.

2. projects/reference_nic_nf1_cml/sw/host/driver: <br> The nf10 driver has been updated to support Linux Kernels 3.17.0 and later.

3. contrib-projects/nf1_cml_io_example: <br> The project demonstrates the use of the onboard LEDs, buttons, SD card, PMODS and DDR memory using standard ISE/EDK IP modules. <br> wiki: [https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-1G-CML-IO-Example-Design](https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-1G-CML-IO-Example-Design)

4. contrib-projects/nf1_cml_crypto_example: <br> The project demonstrates how to access the on-board ATSHA204 CryptoAuthentication chip and on-board Real Time Clock. This project requires the ability to program the on-board PIC MCU. Please see the project README for more details <br> wiki: [https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-1G-CML-Crypto-Example](https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-1G-CML-Crypto-Example)

5. All reference projects in the ./projects directory that do not specifically target the NetFPGA-1G-CML PCB have been removed. This has been done to help reduce any confusion that may exist regarding which projects to use with which card

Thanks,
--CML-Team & NetFPGA-Team
