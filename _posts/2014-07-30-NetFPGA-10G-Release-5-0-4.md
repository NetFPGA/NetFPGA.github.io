Greetings Everyone,

We are happy to announce the next NetFPGA-10G release (5.0.4).

Here are the release notes for 5.0.4:

1. Project related information stored in the bitfile.

We have updated the nf10_identifier module to store information related to date and time the synthesis started, board id, release tag, project identification, project features and misc details. So that once the bitfile is loaded in the FPGA, the driver can parse these registers and give some useful information to the users.

Wikipage: <br> [https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/Project-related-information-in-bitfiles](https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/Project-related-information-in-bitfiles).

The NetFPGA development team along with the NetFPGA community is working diligently to extend and expand the 10G platform.

Thanks,

--NetFPGA-Team
