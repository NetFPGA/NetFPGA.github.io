We are excited to announce that new hardware will be joining the NetFPGA family of open-source networking platforms.

The new board, NetFPGA SUME, is an FPGA-based PCI Express board with I/O capabilities for 10 and 100 Gbps operation, an x8 Gen3 PCIe adapter card incorporating Xilinx's Virtex-7 690T FPGA.

The peripheral subsystems adds to the four SFP+ transceivers with replaceable DDR3-SODIMM memories, QDRII+ memories, as well as presenting the 18 remaining transceivers into two expansion interfaces of eight and ten 13.1 Gbps (GTH) transceivers using an VITA-57 compliant FMC connector and an SAMTEC QTH-DP connector.

An article describing the card is to appear in the upcoming September/October issue of IEEE Micro Magazine - the official link to the article is [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6866035&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fstamp%2Fstamp.jsp%3Ftp%3D%26arnumber%3D6866035). You can access the pre-print version of the paper in the following [link](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nz247/publications/zilberman2014sume.pdf).

At this stage, we want to register the interest in purchasing the board, so as to adapt the upcoming assembly's quantities. If you are interested as an early adopter: joining the alpha programme, or to be kept up to date on the NetFPGA SUME, please fill in this [form]({% link SUME-reg-form.html %}).

We hope you are as excited as we are to have this new addition to our growing family of open-source NetFPGA platforms, and we hope that you will be part of our exciting future.

The NetFPGA SUME team.
