Greetings Everyone,

We are happy to announce the next NetFPGA-10G release (5.0.5)

Below you can find the release notes for 5.0.5:

1. Added the Reference Router GUI interface: <br> <br> The Java GUI allows the user to change entries in the Routing Table and ARP cache as well as the router's MAC and IP addresses. It also provides updates on counter values and graphs of throughput and much more. <br> <br> wiki: [https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-10G-Reference-Router](https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-10G-Reference-Router)

2. Updated statistics for packets dropped counter at the interface: <br> <br> The NetFPGA development team along with the NetFPGA community is working diligently to extend and expand the 10G platform.
