It is with great excitement we announce the release of NetFPGA PLUS.

NetFPGA PLUS 1.0.0

NetFPGA PLUS 1.0.0 has arrived, available in a public repository to all, links on the netfpga.org website. I’ve reprinted the outline, included as part of the original announcement, at the bottom of this newsletter. The overly optimistic timetable fell to the brutal realities of the last 9 months.

NetFPGA PLUS has been  is a momentous effort that largely has fallen to the broad shoulders of the increasingly slim NetFPGA team at Cambridge; one person in particular deserves much credit for this huge effort and for us achieving this first release.

On behalf of us all, I thank Yuta Tokusashi who has lead the NetFPGA PLUS work throughout this effort and who has managed this despite the extraordinary challenges of the last 18 months.

Many critical issues were managed and overcome with the expert guidance of Noa Zilberman, while release testing and preparation would not have been possible without the assistance of Salvator Galea.

This entire effort was enabled by many members of the excellent Xilinx team from Gordon Brebner’s leadership and enthusiasm through to the phenomenal efforts of the Open-NIC team; notably Yan Zhang, and Chris Neely, as well as critical advice from Cathal McCabe, part of Xilinx in Dublin. 

My personal thanks and on behalf of the NetFPGA community to each of them. (I’m excruciatingly aware the moment I send this email I will realise I’ve not credited a critical member of the team - my apologies in advance.)

I will leave some details to a future newsletter - in preparation - but promise it shortly, as soon as we have all caught up on our sleep.

Do check out the new website, thanks to Adam Pettigrew for his efforts there; and of course do check out the public, openly available, Apache licensed, NetFPGA PLUS codebase too!

Items planned for the next announcement will include

1. License change for NetFPGA
2. NetFPGA PLUS plans
3. NetFPGA SUME status


Thank you all,
Andrew Moore
on behalf of the NetFPGA team.
