### 1. NetFPGA news

It is with great sadness the departure of two of the NetFPGA team in Cambridge.

Georgina Kalogeridou and Yury Audzevich have moved on from the University of Cambridge, each have been a huge contributor to the success of the NetFPGA project.

I hope they will involved in the NetFPGA project community.

We will sorely miss them both.

However, we do welcome Salvator Galea and Marcin Wojcik please each of them welcome as they contribute to the activities of the NetFPGA community.
