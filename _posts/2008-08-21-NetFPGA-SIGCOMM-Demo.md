title: NetFPGA Demo wins 2nd place at SIGCOMM 
---
Congratulations to Neda and the rest of the NetFPGA team for the sucessful demonstration of the NetFPGA at the SIGCOMM 2008 conference.Â  The demonstration was second only to the OpenFlow demo, which was awarded as the best demonstration at the conference.  The NetFPGA demo, \"Programmable Routers in Real Networks\", modulated the size of a NetFPGA router\'s packet buffer deployed within the Internet2 to study the effect of TCP throughput.  Live data from the experiment was charted on a Java GUI to confirm that the model predicting the buffer size of RTT*C/Sqrt(N) provides an upper bound on the buffer size needed to obtain full throughput in the network.
