We are pleased to announce the 2017 NetFPGA Design challenge!

The NetFPGA 2017 contest has one design challenge. The design teams have 150 days to produce a working implementation employing any HW and SW design methodology and targeting the NetFPGA SUME platform. The contest begins on November 16th, 2016. The winners will be announced at the NetFPGA Developers summit (Thursday 20th - Friday 21st April, 2017, Cambridge UK)

**Challenge: Lowest Latency Switch**

Low latency devices are Low latency devices are being increasingly used across a large number of applications. Low latency solutions are few, and are rarely open source. The goal of this challenge is to provide a usable, high performance, open source alternative to use by universities and organizations who need the flexibility of open source.
<br>
The systems will be evaluated using OSNT, an Open Source Network Tester. Test benches will be available online prior to workshop day, for users to experiment and independently evaluate their design.
<br>
The competition is open to students of all levels (undergraduate and postgraduate), as well as to non students. There is no need to own a NetFPGA SUME platform to take part in the competition.
