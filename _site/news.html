          <h1>NetFPGA project wins SOSR System Award</h1>
          <h3><i>2 April 2019</i></h3>
          <p><p>Greetings NetFPGA community,</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that the NetFPGA project was awarded today the <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sosr/2019/award.html">ACM SIGCOMM SOSR System Award.</a></p>

<p>The NetFPGA is an open platform enabling researchers and students to build high-speed, hardware-accelerated networking systems. The platform is used by researchers to prototype advanced services for next-generation networks. It is also used in the classroom to teach students how to build network devices, such as Ethernet switches and Internet Protocol (IP) routers. The platform combines both hardware (boards) and software (embedded, tools and applications), together with reference designs and community contributed projects.</p>

<p>Originally developed for teaching at Stanford in 2002 and becoming widely available in 2003, NetFPGA has developed a large community of over 1200 users, using more than 3500 cards, at over 300 universities, in over 60 countries across 6 continents. Alongside supporting academic teaching and research, NetFPGA sees use and contributions from professional research community with over 50 active corporate-based contributors.</p>

<p>The prominent early success of NetFPGA has been its contribution to OpenFlow, which in turn reignited the Software Defined Networking movement. By providing a widely available open-source OpenFlow development platform capable of line-rate operation, NetFPGA was, until commercial uptake, the reference hardware platform for OpenFlow.</p>

<p>In recent years, NetFPGA was increasingly used for the prototyping of programmable data planes, and it currently offers the only open-source hardware target for P4 programs (previously through P4FPGA, and nowadays using the P4-&gt;NetFPGA framework).</p>

<p>NetFPGA has been used for the implementation of over 500 research projects, and to date has been referenced in over three thousand publications.</p>

<p>The NetFPGA project is academically led by the Universities of Cambridge and Stanford, supported by generous donations from Xilinx, Micron, Cypress and Linear Technologies and generous support from the National Science Foundation, DARPA, the Research Council UK through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Council, and the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.</p>

<p>“The CTO Office at Xilinx has been involved in the open source NetFPGA project since its inception. In particular, the Xilinx University Program has ensured that the NetFPGA family – featuring multiple generations of Xilinx FPGAs over the years – has been successfully used by academic researchers and teachers. Xilinx Labs has also had direct technical involvements, ranging from NetFPGA board and shell design on the hardware side, to P4→NetFPGA tool flow development on the software side. Xilinx is very happy to see this well-deserved award, which reflects the great impact of NetFPGA worldwide on research and teaching using FPGA-based software-defined networking.” - Gordon Brebner, Distinguished Engineer, Xilinx Labs</p>

<p>“Cypress is pleased to continue its support for the NetFPGA project and its valuable training and research work in areas including Cyber Security at the Edge and in the Cloud,” said Patrick Kane, director of the Cypress University Alliance, Cypress. “Our relationship with the NetFPGA has spanned over 12 years and has included providing world-class Cypress semiconductor solutions for all versions of the NetFPGA platform.”</p>

<p><strong>Bug Fix:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>nf_axis_converter_v1_0_0: Fix timing issue on the path between the nf_axis_converter and the tx_queue. The timing issue was causing the nf_axis_converter output to be incorrect, which in turn caused the MAC to reject packets of certain lengths. Added an AXIS pipeline stage on the output of the nf_axis_converter</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>Contrb Projects:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>lake: Layered Key-value store, a hardware-based implementation of memcached server</li>
  <li>reference_emu_dns: Implementation of a DNS server with the Emu framework and integrated into the SUME reference data path</li>
  <li>nic_v2: Reference NIC with the new DMA engine core</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>Contrib Cores:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>db_v1_0_1: A key-value cache which stores key-value pair on DRAM and BRAM</li>
  <li>div_v1_0_0: A packet distributer, based on UDP port number and this module acts as in-network computing on-demand controller</li>
  <li>emudns_output_port_lookup_v1_0_0: Output port lookup core generated by the Emu framework with DNS functionality</li>
  <li>input_arbiter_6in_v1_0_0: Provides support for an additional internal high-priority 50Gbps queue</li>
  <li>nf_naudit_dma_v1_0_0: New DMA engine</li>
  <li>nf_sume_pktgen_v1_0_0: Enables internal packet injection at full speed (~50Gbps)</li>

          <p><p>Greetings NetFPGA community,</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce today the next patch release (<strong>1.8.0</strong>) of the NetFPGA-SUME code base.</p>

<p>This release includes:</p>

<p><strong>Fix for manual test via uart not working:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Using UART to run manual test did not work previously for reference_switch and reference_switch_lite. This has been fixed</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>Fix for acceptance test crash in headless mode:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>NfSumeTest.py is run during acceptance test. This script assumed the presence of a display which caused a crash. The fix now allows the script to be run without a display.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>New contribution - script to generate the regs_gen.py file:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The new file csv_gen.py can be used instead of running the excel macro inside module_generation.xlsm.</li>
</ul>

          <p><p>Greetings Everyone,</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of OSNT-SUME (available via <a href="www.osnt.org">www.osnt.org</a>).</p>

<p>The initial OSNT-SUME project is a port of the NetFPGA-10G based OSNTsystem. We are currently planning a native implementation of OSNT-SUME thatwill be able to exploit all the SUME platform capabilities.</p>

<p>The OSNT-SUME repository follows the same criteria as the NetFPGA-SUME repository registration: <a href="/SUME-reg-form.html">http://netfpga.org/SUME-reg-form.html</a></p>

<p>Users that have access to the NetFPGA-SUME repo will have also the access to OSNT-SUME.</p>
