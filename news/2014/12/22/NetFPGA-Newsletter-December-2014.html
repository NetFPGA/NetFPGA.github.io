  <li>Staffing changes and introductions</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="1-sume">1. SUME</h3>

<p>NetFPGA SUME <a href="/NetFPGA-SUME.html">1</a>, described in detail in this article <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6866035">2</a>, is now available for order at the Digilent website <a href="http://bit.ly/1v8YdF5">3</a>.</p>

<p>While it might not be the ideal christmas stocking item; we are excited to see our new board getting into the hands of the user community. The Digilent site has the ordering details <a href="http://bit.ly/1v8YdF5">3</a>.</p>

<p>We will be setting up alpha and beta programmes as in previous years, and let you know when infrastructure is all ready to go; this will happen early in the new year.</p>

<h3 id="2-board-refresh">2. Board refresh</h3>

<p>Alongside the NetFPGA SUME which will server as our flagship project board, the answer to the often asked ‘will you be updating the NetFPGA-1G board’ the answer is a definite yes.</p>

<p>Together with Digilent and CML labs, a NetFPGA release for the CML board has been developed that provides access to ports of the existing (NetFPGA-10G) code base.</p>

<p>See the NetFPGA CML web pages for full details <a href="/NetFPGA-CML.html">4</a></p>

<p>If you want to help in some way please do get in touch.</p>

<h3 id="3-staff-change-and-introductions">3. Staff change and introductions</h3>

<p>2014 saw the departure of long-standing NetFPGA staff Adam Covington, we are glad to hear he is enjoying life in the world beyond NetFPGA.</p>

<p>The team taking on the duties Adam has been doing consists of many people and as first in a series of introductions, I’d like to welcome Georgina Kalogeridou in the role of community manager. Georgina will be known to many of you as the author of the test and simulation frameworks for NetFPGA-10G. As part of this new community-manager role, Georgina has been responsible for the roll-out of the new website and alongside being NetFPGA web boss, she will take a more active role to ensure the mailing lists, online material, and forums work to support users across the entire NetFPGA ecosystem from the older 1G NetFPGA CML and our Flagship: NetFPGA SUME.</p>

<h3 id="4-2015-expectations">4. 2015 Expectations</h3>

<p>We anticipate a busy 2015 for NetFPGA with tutorials for the new NetFPGA SUME in the planning, teaching materials in testing for the NetFPGA boards and a healthy community contributing to current and new projects.</p>

<p>I have plans that this newsletter become a regular item, I hope you won’t object and I promise a limit on number of emails to the netfpga announce list.</p>

<p>Wishing everyone a safe and happy holiday season and</p>

<p>best wishes for the new year,</p>

<p>Andrew.</p>

<p>(temporary) editor of the NetFPGA newsletter</p>
