<p>Greetings NetFPGA Community,</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of OSNT (<a href="http://osnt.org/">www.osnt.org</a>).</p>

<p>The Open Source Network Tester (OSNT) based on the NetFPGA-10G platform, is a the worldâ€™s first open-source hardware traffic generator and capture system.</p>

<p>OSNT repository follows the same criteria as the NetFPGA-10G repository.</p>

<p>Users that have access to the NetFPGA-10G repo will also have access to OSNT.</p>

<p>We invite everyone from the community to audit (and improve) our implementation as well as adapt it to their needs.</p>
