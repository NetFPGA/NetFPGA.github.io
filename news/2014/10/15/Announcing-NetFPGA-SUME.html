<p>We are excited to announce that new hardware will be joining the NetFPGA family of open-source networking platforms.</p>

<p>The new board, NetFPGA SUME, is an FPGA-based PCI Express board with I/O capabilities for 10 and 100 Gbps operation, an x8 Gen3 PCIe adapter card incorporating Xilinx’s Virtex-7 690T FPGA.</p>

<p>The peripheral subsystems adds to the four SFP+ transceivers with replaceable DDR3-SODIMM memories, QDRII+ memories, as well as presenting the 18 remaining transceivers into two expansion interfaces of eight and ten 13.1 Gbps (GTH) transceivers using an VITA-57 compliant FMC connector and an SAMTEC QTH-DP connector.</p>

<p>An article describing the card is to appear in the upcoming September/October issue of IEEE Micro Magazine. You can access the pre-print version of the paper in the following <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nz247/publications/zilberman2014sume.pdf">link</a>.</p>

<p>At this stage, we want to register the interest in purchasing the board, so as to adapt the upcoming assembly’s quantities. If you are interested as an early adopter: joining the alpha programme, or to be kept up to date on the NetFPGA SUME, please fill in this <a href="/SUME-reg-form.html">form</a>.</p>

<p>We hope you are as excited as we are to have this new addition to our growing family of open-source NetFPGA platforms, and we hope that you will be part of our exciting future.</p>

<p>The NetFPGA SUME team.</p>
