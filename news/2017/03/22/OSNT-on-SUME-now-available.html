<p>Greetings Everyone,</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of OSNT-SUME (available via <a href="https://osnt.org">www.osnt.org</a>).</p>

<p>The initial OSNT-SUME project is a port of the NetFPGA-10G based OSNTsystem. We are currently planning a native implementation of OSNT-SUME thatwill be able to exploit all the SUME platform capabilities.</p>

<p>The OSNT-SUME repository follows the same criteria as the NetFPGA-SUME repository registration: <a href="/SUME-reg-form.html">http://netfpga.org/SUME-reg-form.html</a></p>

<p>Users that have access to the NetFPGA-SUME repo will have also the access to OSNT-SUME.</p>

<p>We invite everyone from the community to audit (and improve) our implementation as well as adapt it to their needs</p>

<p>More information can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/NetFPGA/OSNT-Public">https://github.com/NetFPGA/OSNT-Public</a></p>

<p>NetFPGA developers are encouraged to use/contribute to OSNT-SUME repository:</p>
