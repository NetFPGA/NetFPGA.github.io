<p>Greetings NetFPGA community,</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce today the first release of the NetFPGA-SUME code base.</p>

<p>The release includes three reference projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Acceptance test</li>
  <li>Reference NIC</li>
  <li>Reference switch</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual our release also includes a unified test harness, device driver and all other components that make NetFPGA a platform.</p>

<p>NetFPGA-SUME is our first platform to use the Xilinx Vivado tool chain, and while the underlying infrastructure is very different, we believe that you will find the usage experience quite similar to our previous platforms, which should help you quickly and easily start using</p>

<p>If you have not registered to the NetFPGA-SUME beta program, you will need to do so to access the repository: <a href="SUME-reg-form.html">Registration Form</a></p>

<p>Kind Regards,</p>
