<p>Greetings everyone,</p>

<p>We are happy to announce the next NetFPGA-1G-CML release (5.0.5).</p>

<p>Below you can find the release notes for 5.0.5:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>projects/reference_nic_nf1_cml: <br /> The project was modified to support out-of-the-box configuration when it is installed in the on-board BPI during manufacturing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>projects/reference_nic_nf1_cml/sw/host/driver: <br /> The nf10 driver has been updated to support Linux Kernels 3.17.0 and later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contrib-projects/nf1_cml_io_example: <br /> The project demonstrates the use of the onboard LEDs, buttons, SD card, PMODS and DDR memory using standard ISE/EDK IP modules. <br /> wiki: <a href="https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-1G-CML-IO-Example-Design">https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-1G-CML-IO-Example-Design</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>contrib-projects/nf1_cml_crypto_example: <br /> The project demonstrates how to access the on-board ATSHA204 CryptoAuthentication chip and on-board Real Time Clock. This project requires the ability to program the on-board PIC MCU. Please see the project README for more details <br /> wiki: <a href="https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-1G-CML-Crypto-Example">https://github.com/NetFPGA/NetFPGA-public/wiki/NetFPGA-1G-CML-Crypto-Example</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All reference projects in the ./projects directory that do not specifically target the NetFPGA-1G-CML PCB have been removed. This has been done to help reduce any confusion that may exist regarding which projects to use with which card</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks,
â€“CML-Team &amp; NetFPGA-Team</p>
