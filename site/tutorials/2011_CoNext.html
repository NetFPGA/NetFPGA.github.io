<h4>Abstract</h4><br>
<p>
	The <a href="http://www.NetFPGA.org/">NetFPGA</a> is and open platform enabling researchers and instructors to 
	build high-speed, hardware-accelerated networking systems. 
	The platform can be used in the classroom to teach students how to build 
	Ethernet switches and Internet Prototcol (IP) routers using hardware 
	rather than software. The platform can be used by researchers to prototype 
	advanced services for next-generation networks.
</p><br>
<p>
	By using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), 
	the NetFPGA enables new types of packet routing circuits to be 
	implemented and detailed measurements of network traffic to be obtained. 
	During the tutorial, attendees will learn about the NetFPGA platform and
	and how it can be used.  We will demonstrate the use of the reference
	router to dynamically re-route traffic using PW-OSPF with streaming video traffic.
	We will also show how we can extend existing designs to experiment with buffer sizes.
</p><br>
<p>
	No knowledge of Verilog/VHDL is required to attend the tutorial, although knowledge of these languages is needed to program NetFPGA.

<p class="presentorDescription">
Adam is a Research Associate of the High-Performance Network Group (HPN) at Stanford University.  He is currently working on the NetFPGA project, which enables researchers and instructors to build hardware-accelerated networking systems. Previously, he was a Research Associate with the Reconfigurable Network Group (RNG) at Washington University in St. Louis. While at Washington University he designed, and implemented clustering algorithms on FPGAs and supported a hardware accelerated classification system on the FPX platform.  Adamâ€™s current research interests include reconfigurable systems, artificial intelligence (clustering and classification), and applications of artificial intelligence algorithms.  Adam completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from Western Michigan University in April 2003 and accepted a Distinguished Masters of Science Fellowship from Washington University.  He completed his Masters of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Washington University in December 2006.  Adam continues to provide support for the NetFPGA project which includes helping users worldwide as well as arranging and presenting tutorials.
