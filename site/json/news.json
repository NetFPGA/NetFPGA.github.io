The design teams have 150 days to produce a working implementation employing any HW and SW design methodology and targeting the NetFPGA SUME platform. The contest begins on November 16th, 2016. The winners will be announced at the NetFPGA Developers Summit (Thursday 20th - Friday, 21st April, 2017 Cambridge, UK).<br><br><b>Challenge: Lowest Latency Switch</b><br>Low latency devices are being increasingly used across a large number of applications. Low latency solutions are few, and are rarely open source. The goal of this challenge is to provide a usable, high performance, open source alternative to use by universities and organizations who need the flexibility of open source.<br>The systems will be evaluated using OSNT, an Open Source Network Tester. Test benches will be available online prior to workshop day, for users to experiment and independently evaluate their design.<br>The competition is open to students of all levels (undergraduate and postgraduate), as well as to non students.

SUME news<br><br>We have had some questions about changes to the NetFPGA SUME pricing and how best to order boards.<br><br>First of all, some brief background. NetFPGA SUME has a fantastic problem - it is an extremely popular board! This has led to its purchase (at the specially-discounted XUP price of 1,675 USD) by some people who are members of the XUP community but not contributors to the NetFPGA community. Xilinx, Digilent and the NetFPGA team have made the following changes to ensure that a sufficient supply of these specially-discounted boards is available to the members of the NetFPGA community.<br><br>The new price of the NetFPGA SUME for non-academic users is now 9,750 USD. The price for academic users who are not contributing to the NetFPGA community is 4,995 USD. The special price of 1,675 USD for contributors to the NetFPGA community is preserved. To ensure that there are sufficient boards at the specially-discounted price for NetFPGA community members, we have the following guidance:<br><br>'...<br>The specially discounted NetFPGA SUME boards are reserved for projects that contribute significantly to the open-source goals of the NetFPGA project.<br><br>To apply for the discounted rate, please submit a brief abstract of your project to Digilent using the following link:<br>https://netfpga.wufoo.com/forms/netfpga-special-pricing-request/<br><br>State clearly how your work contributes to the NetFPGA community. The requests will be evaluated by experts from both Xilinx and the NetFPGA team. Successful applicants will be advised by Digilent how to order their boards at the discounted prices.<br>...'<br><br>The intent of this arrangement is to prioritize access to the specially-discounted NetFPGA SUME boards for the active, contributing members of the NetFPGA community. All other academic groups will still be able to purchase the NetFPGA SUME boards at the higher, (but still heavily subsidized), price of 4,995 USD.<br><br>We hope that these arrangements will ensure a steady supply of NetFPGA SUME boards to the networking community.<br><br>For those that have had confusing messages from their local Digilent distributors, we encourage you to let Digilent at sales@digilentinc.com know the details as some distributors are operating with old information.<br><br>-=-=-<br><br>3. SUME release<br><br>We are planning for SUME release 1.0 at the end of the week (26th of June).<br><br>This release will include<br><br>* An acceptance test for you to run to ensure your board is in good health.<br><br>The acceptance test was designed to test new boards in a standard operating mode, and it enables testing the major interfaces without special test fixtures.<br><br>* Following the acceptance test release, we will start to regularly release SUME reference projects, starting with the reference NIC.<br><br>This project is the first of our reference projects and as well as the corse to construct a reference NIC bitfile, it will include linux device drivers, and various support scripts. The reference NIC in this version uses the popular RIFFA DMA engine which is capable of PCI-e gen2 http://riffa.ucsd.edu<br><br>All the NetFPGA SUME projects are using Xilinx's Vivado tool-chain and a tcl-based design flow.<br><br>* Simulation test environment<br><br>* Hardware test environment<br><br>For those wanting other reference projects - we have not forgotten you, we are simply running to catchup on this new board and once we have version 1.0 we will look to future releases that will include<br><br>* Reference IPv4 Router<br><br>* Reference Ethernet Switch<br><br>and perhaps most exciting<br><br>* Reference Multi-table OpenFlow switch - compatible with 1.4<br><br>We are also working hard to have an open-source DMA engine that will perform as well as the hardware can offer - a labour of love - we will provide updates as we have them.<br><br>Look for announcements on the SUME mailing list.<br><br>-=-=- Want to be a contributor not just a consumer? email me -=-=-<br><br>4.

Can you help us port and test interesting projects in the coming months?<br><br>NetFPGA-CML has replaced the NetFPGA-1G and is provided with the support of CML. This board supports users who want to build systems based on the reference projects with a limit to 1G Ethernet UTP cabling and 4 x 1Gb/s data rates.  Additional facilities, including a CryptAuthentication chip and a real-time clock are also part of the CML board.<br><br>NetFPGA-10G has been our venerable Virtex-5 workhorse and while projects will still be developed for this board, at the end of 2015 we will look to move this board to join NetFPGA-1G as being supported by the community. To make this happen we want community members to step forward who are willing to work alongside our development team, accepting patches as required and ensuring the 10G board questions get answered. Nothing arduous but this is a community board with community support. With volunteer help we expect to formally move the mailing list into the forums as we find these provide the best method for the community to support itself.<br><br>NetFPGA-1G is no longer available for purchase but continues to be supported by the community.

The NetFPGA platform enables researchers and instructors to build high-speed, hardware-accelerated networking systems. The platform can be used by researchers to prototype advanced services for next-generation networks. By using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), the NetFPGA enables new types of packet routing circuits to be implemented and detailed measurements of network traffic to be obtained. The contest is split into two challenges. Teams can participate in either or both challenges. The design teams have 120 days to produce a working implementation employing any HW and SW design methodology and targeting the NetFPGA development platform. The contest begins on Feb 9th, 2010.<br> Challenge 1: The Best Network Tester/Packet Capture system There are a small number of very expensive packet generator and capture systems on the market, used for testing networks and network equipment. The goal of this design is to provide a usable, powerful and open-source alternative for use by universities and organizations unable to afford such expensive equipment.<br> Challenge 2: The Best Overall Network System Design The goal is to design and implement a novel design on the NetFPGA system. Use your imagination to devise a new use case for the NetFPGA. We are looking for solutions utilizing the NetFPGA cards that perform significant networking functionality. The 1st place team will receive: $1,000 cash award, two NetFPGA-1G cards (or one NetFPGA-10G card when they become available), and the right to choose a school to receive 5 new NetFPGA-1G cards. Up to two team members of the 1st place team will receive an expenses-paid trip (flight, hotel and registration) to come and present your design at a NetFPGA Developers Conference. The 2nd place team will receive $600 cash award. The 3rd place team will receive $400 cash award.<br> "

        "Description": "Congratulations to Neda and the rest of the NetFPGA team for the sucessful demonstration of the NetFPGA at the SIGCOMM 2008 conference. The demonstration was second only to the OpenFlow demo, which was awarded as the best demonstration at the conference. The NetFPGA demo, Programmable Routers in Real Networks, modulated the size of a NetFPGA routers packet buffer deployed within the Internet2 to study the effect of TCP throughput. Live data from the experiment was charted on a Java GUI to confirm that the model predicting the buffer size of RTT*C/Sqrt(N) provides an upper bound on the buffer size needed to obtain full throughput in the network."
